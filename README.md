## About
- Homework assignment for Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp, due April 22nd, 2019. Friend-Finder is a heroku-based app that takes in some user-input information, stores it as JSON, and retrieves other user json data to compare and find the closest match with the surveyed user. The algorithm behind this isn't particularly advanced, and is a simple number comparison; the match itself is meaningless, this app is mostly a proof of concept and demonstration of using the Heroku CLI, Node, and Express.

Inputting real personal information that could be traced back to you probably wouldn't be a good idea, none of the content is vetted or anything.

## Known Issues/Bugs
- Application can't really handle user skipping over questions or inputs very well.
- Responsiveness may suffer on lower screen widths.
- Most CSS/HTML is simple placeholder; it isn't pretty but it's functional.
